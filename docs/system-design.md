# ⚙️ System Design Deep Dive

This document provides a deeper technical explanation of the internal design decisions behind the **Low-Latency Quant Trading Engine**.

It focuses on engineering structure rather than trading logic.

---

## 🎯 Design Objectives

The engine was designed with the following primary goals:

- ultra-low latency execution paths
- deterministic behavior under load
- predictable memory allocation
- strict isolation of trading logic from infrastructure
- resilience against exchange instability
- safe crash recovery
- horizontal scalability without self-competition

---

## 🧱 Component Isolation

Each major subsystem operates behind a strict interface boundary.

marketdata → ingestion & normalization
orderbook → state reconstruction
microstructure → signal extraction
strategies → decision intent
execution → order lifecycle
risk → exposure control
exchange → API abstraction
persistence → recovery & durability

This separation allows independent optimization without cascading side effects.

## ⚡ Latency-Critical Path

The primary latency-sensitive flow is:

WebSocket Tick
↓
Delta Decode
↓
Orderbook Update
↓
Signal Evaluation
↓
Execution Decision
↓
Order Transmission

This path is kept:

- allocation-minimal
- lock-bounded
- free of disk I/O
- free of logging
- free of network blocking

All non-critical work is offloaded asynchronously.

---

## 🧠 Memory Model

Key principles:

- preallocated structures where possible
- bounded containers
- object reuse for hot paths
- avoidance of reflection
- limited heap churn

The engine is designed to minimize garbage collection pressure during live trading.

---

## 🔁 Concurrency Model

The system follows a message-driven architecture:

- market data operates on dedicated goroutines
- orderbook updates occur sequentially per symbol
- execution operates independently
- persistence runs asynchronously
- metrics collection is non-blocking

This model ensures deterministic ordering without excessive locking.

---

## 🔍 Microstructure Analysis

All market intelligence is derived from:

- orderbook depth behavior
- liquidity migration
- price-level interaction
- aggressive vs passive flow

No candle-based indicators or historical technical analysis are used.

---

## ⚔️ Execution Strategy

Execution focuses on:

- limit-order priority
- controlled repricing
- avoidance of unstable depth
- queue-position awareness
- adaptive aggressiveness based on liquidity

The engine prioritizes **execution quality**, not signal frequency.

---

## 🛑 Risk Enforcement

Risk checks are applied:

- before order placement
- after every fill
- during volatility expansion
- on latency degradation
- on drawdown breach

The risk engine has absolute authority to disable trading instantly.

---

## 💾 Persistence Strategy

State persistence is designed to be:

- incremental
- non-blocking
- append-oriented
- crash-safe

On restart, the engine reconstructs its last known execution state before resuming operation.

---

## 🧬 Multi-Instance Coordination

When running multiple engine processes:

- leader election determines execution authority
- cooldown locks prevent overlapping orders
- position ownership is enforced
- execution rights can migrate safely

This allows scaling without internal market impact.

---

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

The system is validated using:

- deterministic orderbook replay
- simulated exchange responses
- latency instrumentation
- failure injection testing

Testing focuses on behavior under stress rather than profit metrics.

---

## 📌 Summary

This trading engine is designed as:

- infrastructure-first
- execution-centric
- latency-aware
- failure-resilient

It reflects real-world engineering challenges found in professional trading environments.
